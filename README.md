#ResponsiveAnalogRead

ResponsiveAnalogRead will be an Arduino library for eliminating noise in analogRead inputs without decreasing responsiveness.

See the comments in ResponsiveAnalogRead.h or the examples below for details.

##How to use

Download the files in this repo and put them in a folder called "ResponsiveAnalogRead" in your Arduino libraries folder. It should be something like this:

```
<Your arduino library directory>/ResponsiveAnalogRead/ResponsiveAnalogRead.h
<Your arduino library directory>/ResponsiveAnalogRead/ResponsiveAnalogRead.cpp
```

Once you have it set up, look at the example in the examples folder for an idea on how to use it in your own projects.

##Further functionality
See ResponsiveAnalogRead.h for details on any remaining functionality it provides.
